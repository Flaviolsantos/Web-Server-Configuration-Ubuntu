‚óΩ Go to `cd sites-available/` and do a soft link to seguro ‚û°Ô∏è `ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seguro seguro` ‚û°Ô∏è This is made so you can activate the configuration ‚ùó

‚óΩ In the end Restart nginx ‚û°Ô∏è `systemctl restart nginx`

‚úîÔ∏è to check if its working go to you browser ( a client Instance or your own browser) and search ‚û°Ô∏è http://IP.publico  and https://IP:publico
